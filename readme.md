# Air Pollution Trends and Impacts in the United States (2000-2022)

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze air pollution trends in the United States from 2000 to 2022, utilizing a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle. The focus is on key pollutants such as  NO2, SO2, and CO. By applying statistical analyses, machine learning models, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and KMeans clustering, the project seeks to understand pollution trends, assess their impacts, and evaluate the effectiveness of environmental policies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle:
- [US Pollution Data (2000 to 2022)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guslovesmath/us-pollution-data-200-to-2022)

## Objectives

1. **Analyze Trends:** Examine how pollution levels have changed from 2000 to 2022.
2. **Assess Impacts:** Evaluate the health and environmental impacts of key pollutants.
3. **Evaluate Policies:** Assess the effectiveness of environmental regulations in reducing pollution.
4. **Recommend Actions:** Provide insights and recommendations for future air quality management.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Gather and preprocess the historical pollution data.
2. **Data Analysis:** Use statistical techniques to analyze trends and correlations.
3. **Machine Learning Models:** Implement models to predict future pollution levels and assess influencing factors.
4. **PCA and Clustering:** Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction and KMeans clustering to identify patterns.
5. **Visualization:** Create visualizations to illustrate trends, clusters, and model performance.

## Results

- **Trend Analysis:** Identified significant reductions in major pollutants over the study period.
- **Impact Assessment:** Correlated reduced pollution levels with improved public health outcomes.
- **Policy Evaluation:** Demonstrated the effectiveness of key regulations like the Clean Air Act.

## Conclusion

The project highlights significant progress in reducing air pollution in the United States over the past two decades. Effective policies and technological innovations have played crucial roles in these improvements. The findings underscore the importance of continued efforts to monitor and manage air quality to protect public health and the environment.

## Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Continuous and enhanced monitoring of air quality.
2. **Policy Updates:** Regularly review and update environmental policies.
3. **Public Engagement:** Increase public awareness and involvement in air quality issues.
4. **Targeted Actions:** Implement specific measures in regions with high pollution levels.
